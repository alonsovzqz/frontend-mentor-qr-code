## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this challenge I was able to test my skills with CSS and even when this is a "simple" challenge it actually helped me to make some decisions on whether was convenient to set a fixed width and height of the card itself or just make it responsive.

At the end I decided to go with a fixed width and height since the designs didn't reflect any changes from the mobile perspective to the desktop design and that way everything was a little bit faster.

### Continued development

Something I'd like to look for improvement could be the use of semantic HTML and or ARIA attributes for it. Since it's just a simple card (or a `div` in this case) I'm not completely sure how to handle it.

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - This helped me to start working with the BEM methodology I'm using in my solution.
